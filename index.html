    <blockquote>When I was 12 years old my 17 year old brother was killed, shot dead on D.C.streets, this was in 1995, from that day forward I vowed to never have children because I was too scared someone will kill my child…but life goes on &amp; needles to say I’m 30 years old with 3 kids, when I became pregnant I prayed to God that I didn’t have boys because they always seem to get killed, I have two boys..My point is the world is so cold, girl or boy you just might end up dead!!

        No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: <em>any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</em>
